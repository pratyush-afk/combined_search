Based on the documents provided, here are the steps to transfer a passenger from one flight to another using the Sabre system. ### **Prerequisites** * To use the transfer entry, your EPR (Employee Profile Record) must contain the `SELECT` keyword. * To transfer a passenger by line number, you must first display a passenger list (e.g., a revenue list or priority list). --- ### **Step 1: Display the Passenger List** First, you need to display the list of passengers for the original flight to identify the line number(s) of the passenger(s) you want to transfer. * **Sabre Format:** `G*L[Flight Number]/RV` (for a revenue list) or `G*L[Flight Number]/PALL` (for a priority list). * **Example:** To see the revenue passenger list for flight 1288, you would enter: `G*L1288/RV` The system will return a list of passengers, each with an assigned line number. ### **Step 2: Use the GTR Entry to Transfer the Passenger(s)** Once you have the line number(s), use the `GTR` (Go Transfer) command. You can transfer specific passengers by their line number or all passengers at once. #### **Method A: Transfer Specific Passengers by Line Number** This is used to transfer one or more selected passengers. * **Sabre Format:** `GTR[line number(s)][new flight number]/[date][route]` * **Examples:** * To transfer the passenger on line 1 to flight 378 on October 29th to DFW: `GTR1,378/29OCTDFW` * To transfer passengers on lines 5 through 7 and line 10 to a new flight (assuming the new flight details are already in the system context): `GTR5-7,10` #### **Method B: Transfer All Revenue Passengers** This is used to transfer the entire list of revenue passengers to an alternate flight. * **Sabre Format:** `GTRALL[new flight number]/[date][route]` * **Example:** * To transfer all revenue passengers to flight 78 on October 29th to DFW: `GTRALL78/29OCTDFW` ### **Step 3: Add Optional Parameters (If Needed)** You can add options to the `GTR` entry to perform additional actions. * **/CKIN**: Checks in the transferred passengers on the new flight and issues boarding passes if seats are available. This is limited to entries with 10 or fewer passengers. * **Example:** `GTR1-3/CKIN` * **/SPLITOK**: Used with `/CKIN`, this option allows the system to split passengers traveling together (in the same PNR) if there are not enough seats together on the new flight. * **Example:** `GTR1-3100/17NOVHNLSFO/CKIN/SPLITOK` * **/L**: Places the passenger on the priority list of the new flight without assigning a seat or issuing a boarding pass. * *(This option is mentioned in the overview but not shown in the specific entry examples.)* ### **System Actions After Transfer** When you execute the transfer, the system automatically performs the following actions: * **Rebooks the PNR:** Cancels the original flight segment and inserts the new flight segment. * **Updates Baggage:** Any checked baggage information is updated to reflect the passenger's new route. * **Issues Boarding Pass:** If a seat is available (and the `/CKIN` option is used or implied), a boarding pass for the new flight is issued. If a seat is not available, the passenger is placed on the priority list. * **Copies Information:** Passenger characteristics (Edit Codes) are copied from the original flight to the new one.
